# Hello! Pietro, aka PC, here

## Brief bio and about me

I'm a PhD student in Aerospace Engineering at DARTLab, Politecnico di Milano.
My research focuses on the intersection of computer vision, SLAM algorithms, and machine learning, all applied to spacecraft navigation. Curiosity is my greatest strength. No matter the subject, I approach everything with awe and enthusiasm ✨

**Motto** 🔥: *“Wonder is anywhere, if you are curious enough to discover it.”*

**Coding related motto** 🤖: *“Give me a task and I will code a general SW library to automate it.”*
